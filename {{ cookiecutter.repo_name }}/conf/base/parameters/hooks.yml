# Define queries that should be done to azure key vault(s) to obtain credentials
# These credentials will be appended to credentials.yml after context is created
# 
# For example, if...
# key_vault_queries:
#   <user-defined name>: 
#     key_vault_name: "{{ cookiecutter.azure_prefix_alphanum }}devkv"
#     account_name: "{{ cookiecutter.azure_prefix_alphanum }}devst"
#     storage_key_id: "{{ cookiecutter.azure_prefix_alphanum }}devst-key"
# 
# ... then AzureSecretsHook will try to query the credentials of "{{ cookiecutter.azure_prefix_alphanum }}devst" 
# from from key vault "{{ cookiecutter.azure_prefix_alphanum }}devkv" using the service_principal 
# credentials as defined in credentials.yml.
# 
# If succesful, the following credentials will then be appended to credentials.yml:
# <user-defined name>: 
#   account_name: "{{ cookiecutter.azure_prefix_alphanum }}devst"
#   account_key: <Storage account access key>
